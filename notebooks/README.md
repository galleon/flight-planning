# Notebook

# # Introduction
To run the notebook using VSCode, you need to install the ipykernel package in the virtual environment. This is done by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
pip install ipykernel
```

Then, you need to add the virtual environment to the list of kernels available in VSCode. This is done by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=venv
```

Finally, you need to select the kernel in VSCode. This is done by clicking on the kernel icon in the top right corner of the notebook and selecting the kernel you want to use.
